-   Hi there! 😄

-   In this repo you should see the following:

    -   Orignial code (r markdown)

    -   Original code (html)

    -   Final code based off of the original code \^ (r markdown)

    -   Cute picture of the titi monkey🐒

-   My orignial code which incorporates all questions asked in the HW 2 file

-   Each section should be the title/ header before the notes and code are shown

-   I have comments in my code sections to help my readers and myself understand what's going on or my thought process in general, let me know if they are confusing

-   In my original code is also 5 struggles I encountered while doing homework 2

Thank you for reading this!👍

### 5 Struggles I Have Encountered Doing HW 2

1.  **Challenge 1: Understanding Probability Functions (ppois vs. dpois)**
    1.  At first, I was confused about the difference between ppois() and dpois(). I initially used the wrong function in my calculations, which led to incorrect probability values. After looking through the required R textbook and discussing it with my peer commentator, Amita, I finally understood the distinction:

        dpois(x, lambda): Gives the exact probability of observing x events.

        ppois(x, lambda): Gives the cumulative probability of observing x or fewer events.

        Amita was very helpful in explaining this, and I’m glad I was able to apply it correctly in the end.
2.  **Challenge 2: Group Member’s Delay and How We Adapted**
    1.  One of our group members had trouble getting R to work and did not contact Professor Schmit until Saturday. This put Amita and me in an awkward position because we weren’t sure whether to move forward or wait. Eventually, we decided to continue reviewing each other’s code while waiting, so we wouldn’t lose progress. I also made a plan to go back and review Alexandra’s code later when she was done. This experience showed me how important it is to communicate in group projects and be flexible when unexpected delays happen.
3.  **Challenge 3: Struggling with ggplot2 and Piping (%\>%)**
    1.  I had trouble organizing my ggplot2 code properly and found it overwhelming when I kept getting error messages. It was frustrating to debug, especially not knowing when to use the %\>% (pipe) operator for data manipulation. To manage this, I came up with a strategy: Each time I added a new element to ggplot(), I would comment on it and label it so I knew exactly what I was doing. I also worked step by step, adding one feature at a time and testing it before moving forward. This method really helped me understand ggplot2 better and made my code more readable.
4.  **Challenge 4: GitHub Sync Issues (pull before push)**
    1.  I ran into the same issue as last week where I forgot to pull my group member’s changes before trying to push my own updates. This created a conflict, and R thought I was trying to push to a different branch. At first, this was very stressful, but I was able to figure out how to solve it on my own: I used git pull first to sync my local files with the remote repository. After resolving the differences, I was finally able to push my changes successfully. Even though it was frustrating, I felt really good about solving the problem by myself this time!
5.  **Challenge 5: Time Management and Falling Behind Due to Illness**
    1.  Over the weekend, I caught the flu, which made it difficult to stay on top of my coursework. I wasn’t able to work on Module 8 before starting Homework 2, and looking back, I realize that doing the module first would have helped me complete the assignment more efficiently. To avoid this issue in the future, I plan to: Complete modules as early as possible before class so I have more time to absorb the material. Start homework only after finishing the related module, so I don’t have to struggle through concepts I haven’t fully learned yet. This experience reminded me that unexpected things can happen, and I need to improve my time management so I don’t fall behind.
