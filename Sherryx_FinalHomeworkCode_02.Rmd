## 5 Struggles I Have Encountered Doing HW 2

1.  **Challenge 1: Understanding Probability Functions (ppois vs. dpois)**

    1.  At first, I was confused about the difference between ppois() and dpois(). I initially used the wrong function in my calculations, which led to incorrect probability values. After looking through the required R textbook and discussing it with my peer commentator, Amita, I finally understood the distinction:

        dpois(x, lambda): Gives the exact probability of observing x events.

        ppois(x, lambda): Gives the cumulative probability of observing x or fewer events.

        Amita was very helpful in explaining this, and I’m glad I was able to apply it correctly in the end.

2.  **Challenge 2: Group Member’s Delay and How We Adapted**

    1.  One of our group members had trouble getting R to work and did not contact Professor Schmit until Saturday. This put Amita and me in an awkward position because we weren’t sure whether to move forward or wait. Eventually, we decided to continue reviewing each other’s code while waiting, so we wouldn’t lose progress. I also made a plan to go back and review Alexandra’s code later when she was done. This experience showed me how important it is to communicate in group projects and be flexible when unexpected delays happen.

3.  **Challenge 3: Struggling with ggplot2 and Piping (%\>%)**

    1.  I had trouble organizing my ggplot2 code properly and found it overwhelming when I kept getting error messages. It was frustrating to debug, especially not knowing when to use the %\>% (pipe) operator for data manipulation. To manage this, I came up with a strategy: Each time I added a new element to ggplot(), I would comment on it and label it so I knew exactly what I was doing. I also worked step by step, adding one feature at a time and testing it before moving forward. This method really helped me understand ggplot2 better and made my code more readable.

4.  **Challenge 4: GitHub Sync Issues (pull before push)**

    1.  I ran into the same issue as last week where I forgot to pull my group member’s changes before trying to push my own updates. This created a conflict, and R thought I was trying to push to a different branch. At first, this was very stressful, but I was able to figure out how to solve it on my own: I used git pull first to sync my local files with the remote repository. After resolving the differences, I was finally able to push my changes successfully. Even though it was frustrating, I felt really good about solving the problem by myself this time!

5.  **Challenge 5: Time Management and Falling Behind Due to Illness**

    1.  Over the weekend, I caught the flu, which made it difficult to stay on top of my coursework. I wasn’t able to work on Module 8 before starting Homework 2, and looking back, I realize that doing the module first would have helped me complete the assignment more efficiently. To avoid this issue in the future, I plan to: Complete modules as early as possible before class so I have more time to absorb the material. Start homework only after finishing the related module, so I don’t have to struggle through concepts I haven’t fully learned yet. This experience reminded me that unexpected things can happen, and I need to improve my time management so I don’t fall behind.

## 1. Probability of Hearing More than 8 Calls

```{r}
#originally resercher hears 15 calls
exact <- 15

#set up probability that she will hear 8 or more calls over the original 15 calls
#1- because we want 8 or more calls
eight_or_more <- 1 - ppois(8, exact)

#show result
eight_or_more
```

## 2. Probability of Hearing No Calls

```{r}
#originally resercher hears 15 calls
exact <- 15

#set up probability that she will hear no calls over the original 15 calls
#I did not use 1 - (100 percent chance of hearing call), because she heard no calls and there are no greater than...
#Listened from Amita and used dpois instead of ppois
no_call <- dpois(0, exact)

#show result
no_call
```

## 3. Probability of Hearing Exactly 3 Calls

```{r}
#originally resercher hears 15 calls
exact <- 15

#set up probability that she will hear 3 calls over the original 15 calls
#No 1- because we want EXCATLY 3 calls
#Listened from Amita and used dpois instead of ppois
three_calls <- dpois(3, exact)

#show result
three_calls
```

## 4. Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30

```{r}
# this is the x values for the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30
x_range <- 0:30
poisson_mass_function <- dpois(x_range, exact)

#provide a summary of the data: mean, median...
summary(poisson_mass_function)
```

```{r}
# Plot PMF
#Import the data created above
ggplot(data = data.frame(x_range, poisson_mass_function), aes(x = x_range, y = poisson_mass_function)) +
  
  #i need to fill the data otherwise nothing shows up on my figure
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "purple", alpha = 0.6) +
  
  #figure title and organization
    labs(title = "Poisson Probability Mass Function",
         x = "Number of Calls", y = "Probability") +
  
  #prettifying by using a theme
    theme_minimal()
```

## 5. Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).

```{r}
#originally resercher hears 15 calls
exact <- 15

# Simulate 104 Poisson-distributed monitoring sessions
#still over 15 as the original distribution: Average number of events per interval
# I used rpois: random density for poisson distribution instead of ppois which is probability distribution
stimulated_data <- rpois(104, exact)

#show result
stimulated_data

#provide a summary of the data: mean, median...
summary(stimulated_data)
```

## 6. Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Plot histogram of simulated data
ggplot(data = data.frame(stimulated_data), aes(x = stimulated_data)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.6, color = "black") +
   
  #labeling the graph
   labs(title = "Histogram of 104 Simulated Poisson Data",
         x = "Number of Calls", y = "Frequency") +
 
  #setting the horizontal limit from 0 to 30 
     xlim(0, 30) +
    theme_minimal()
```

-   The shape of the probability mass function I plotted above is 100% symmetrical

-   The simulated data still follows the overall trend of the PMF, but its not the same

    -   with some variations due to randomness of the 104 variables

    -   The histogram is therefore not symmetrical, bump on the left and right side

    -   this is a more accurate representation of what real life scientific data looks like
